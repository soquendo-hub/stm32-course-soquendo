# KNOWLEDGE.md — Week 3: MCU Architecture and Bare-Metal Programming

## Overview

This week the student transitions from abstract C programming and bitwise operations to understanding how the microcontroller is organized internally. Many concepts that were presented as "black boxes" in previous weeks now start becoming transparent. The student learns to read official technical documentation (reference manual, datasheet), understands how peripherals connect to the CPU through buses, and begins to see CMSIS structures not as magic but as carefully designed overlays on the hardware. The debugger becomes a tool for inspecting the microcontroller's internal state directly through the SFR (Special Function Registers) view.

---

## Previously Mastered Topics (Weeks 0–2)

The student understands CMOS technology, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits. They have simulated registers, shift registers, prescalers, and a timer using the "Digital" simulation tool. They understand binary, hexadecimal, and 2's complement number systems.

In C programming, the student can write programs using `if/else`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`, `switch-case`, and fixed-width data types from `stdint.h` (`uint8_t`, `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, `int16_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`). They understand arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), shift operators (`>>`, `<<`), and boolean evaluation (0 is false, anything not 0 is true). Their C skills are still developing — expect occasional syntax errors and uncertainty.

The student knows all bitwise logic operators: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), NOT (`~`), XOR (`^`), and their compound assignment forms: `|=` for setting bits, `&= ~()` for clearing bits, `^=` for toggling bits. They understand the concept of a mask as a value created to modify specific bits in another variable. They have applied these operations both to regular variables and to real MCU registers as a first exposure (enabling RCC clock and turning on an LED), though that register-level work was presented at a "black box" level without full architectural explanation.

The student knows `#include` and `#define` at a basic level. They can create projects in STM32CubeIDE, use the debugger to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.

The student has been introduced to Finite State Machines (FSM) as a design tool — state diagrams, identifying states and transitions, describing system behavior. This is conceptual only; no FSM code implementation has been done. The student does NOT yet know `enum`.

The student does NOT know structures, unions, arrays, pointers, enumerations, or `typedef`. The `->` operator was introduced in week 2 only as "the way to access registers" without explanation.

## Current Learning Focus (Week 3)

### MCU architecture

The student is learning how the STM32F4xx microcontroller is organized internally: the ARM Cortex-M4 CPU core, the bus system, and how peripherals connect to the CPU. The specific buses covered are AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus), APB1 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 1 — low-speed peripherals), and APB2 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 2 — high-speed peripherals). The student learns which peripherals are connected to which bus and why this matters — for example, GPIO ports are on AHB1, USART2 is on APB1. The student understands that each peripheral needs a clock signal enabled through the RCC (Reset and Clock Control) before it can be used.

### Memory-mapped registers and SFR

The student is learning that peripherals in the microcontroller are controlled through Special Function Registers (SFR) that are mapped to specific memory addresses. Writing a value to a memory address is the same as writing to a peripheral register — this is the fundamental concept of memory-mapped I/O. The student can now connect the abstract idea of "bits in a variable" to "bits that control real hardware behavior."

### CMSIS structures — the Italian tailor analogy

The student is learning how CMSIS provides C structures that are carefully designed to overlay perfectly on the memory layout of each peripheral — like a dress made by an Italian tailor: custom made, perfect fit. Every member of the structure corresponds to a real register at a real memory address. The `->` operator now moves from a pure black box to a navigational concept: `GPIOA->MODER` means "access the MODER register inside the GPIOA peripheral." The student understands this at a practical level — they know what the operation does — but the underlying C mechanism (pointers to structures) is NOT yet explained. If the student asks how this works internally, reinforce the tailor analogy: "the structure is perfectly shaped to match the hardware layout, and `->` takes you to the specific register you need. You will understand how this is built internally later in the course."

### Reading official documentation

The student is learning to read and navigate the STM32F4xx reference manual and datasheet to find register descriptions, bit field definitions, and peripheral information. The AI should consistently encourage the student to look up information in the official documentation rather than providing answers directly. When guiding the student, phrases like "check the reference manual, section X, for the register description" are appropriate and expected at this level.

### Debugger — SFR view

The student is learning to use the SFR (Special Function Registers) view in the STM32CubeIDE debugger to inspect peripheral registers directly in real time. This is different from watching regular variables — the student can now see the actual hardware state change in response to their code. The AI should use this as a teaching tool: "after you write that line, open the SFR view, navigate to RCC → AHB1ENR, and check which bit changed. Is it the one you expected?"

### Guidance for these topics

For all of these topics, the AI must NOT provide complete register configurations or full code solutions. Instead, guide the student by asking questions about which bus a peripheral is on, which register controls a specific behavior, and what value they expect to see in the SFR view after an operation. Let the student navigate the reference manual and find the answers themselves. The AI can confirm or correct the student's findings, but the discovery process should be theirs.

# KNOWLEDGE.md — Week 4: General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)

## Overview

This week the student is learning how to configure and use GPIO pins for digital input and output at the register level, using direct register manipulation through CMSIS structures and CMSIS-defined masks. This is the first week where the student makes the microcontroller perform a visible, physical action. It is also the week where enumerations (`enum`) are introduced and FSM design concepts from week 2 are implemented in code for the first time.

The student understands CMOS technology, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits. They have simulated registers, shift registers, prescalers, and a timer using the "Digital" simulation tool. They understand binary, hexadecimal, and 2's complement number systems.

The student knows all bitwise logic operators: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), NOT (`~`), XOR (`^`), and their compound assignment forms: `|=` for setting bits, `&= ~()` for clearing bits, `^=` for toggling bits. They understand the concept of a mask as a value created to modify specific bits without affecting others.

The student understands the MCU architecture: the ARM Cortex-M4 CPU core, the bus system (AHB, APB1, APB2), which peripherals connect to which bus, and that peripherals need a clock signal enabled through the RCC before they can be used. They understand memory-mapped registers and Special Function Registers (SFR) — that writing a value to a specific memory address controls a peripheral's behavior.

The student understands CMSIS structures as carefully designed overlays on the hardware memory layout — like a dress made by an Italian tailor: custom made, perfect fit. The `->` operator is understood as a way to navigate to a specific register within a specific peripheral (for example, `GPIOA->MODER` means "access the MODER register inside the GPIOA peripheral"). The underlying C mechanism (pointers to structures) is NOT yet understood — this remains a "trust the tailor" concept. Do not explain structures or pointers if asked; reinforce the tailor analogy and say the full explanation will come later in the course.

The student can read and navigate the STM32F4xx reference manual and datasheet to find register descriptions, bit field definitions, and peripheral information. The AI should consistently encourage looking up information in the official documentation.

The student can use the SFR view panel (Special Function Registers) of the debugger in VS Code (STM32 extension pack) to inspect peripheral registers directly in real time, verifying that register operations produce the expected results at the hardware level.

The student has been introduced to Finite State Machines (FSM) as a design tool — state diagrams, identifying states and transitions, describing system behavior (turnstile example: blocked → coin → open → cross → blocked). This was conceptual only in week 2; this week the student will implement FSM patterns in code for the first time.

The student does NOT know structures, unions, arrays, or pointers. The `typedef` keyword is NOT yet known beyond what the project template auto-generates. Function pointers and dynamic memory allocation are NOT known.

## Current Learning Focus (Week 4)

### GPIO register configuration

The student is learning to configure and use GPIO pins at the register level using CMSIS-defined structures and named masks. The specific registers being learned this week are: enabling the clock for a GPIO port through `RCC->AHB1ENR`, configuring pin modes using the `MODER` register (input, output, alternate function, analog), understanding output type through the `OTYPER` register (push-pull vs open-drain), setting output speed through the `OSPEEDR` register, configuring pull-up and pull-down resistors through the `PUPDR` register, writing to output pins through `ODR` or `BSRR`, and reading input pin states through `IDR`.

### CMSIS-defined masks and named constants

The student is learning to use CMSIS-defined masks and named constants for register operations instead of building masks manually with shift operators. For example, using `RCC_AHB1ENR_GPIOAEN` instead of `(1 << 0)`, or `GPIO_MODER_MODER5` instead of `(0x03 << 10)`. The AI should use and encourage CMSIS-style named constants in all register operations. When guiding the student, the AI can ask: "What is the CMSIS name for the mask that controls pin 5's mode?" rather than "What bit position controls pin 5?"

### Enumerations (`enum`)

The student is learning the `enum` keyword in C as a way to define named integer constants that represent a set of related values. This is introduced primarily as a tool for FSM implementation — defining state names that are more readable than raw numbers. For example, `enum trafficLight_States { RED, GREEN, YELLOW };` gives meaningful names to states instead of using 0, 1, 2.

### FSM code implementation

The student is implementing FSM patterns in code for the first time, combining `enum` for state definitions with `switch-case` for state transitions. This connects the conceptual FSM design work from week 2 (state diagrams, turnstile example) to actual running code that controls real hardware (LEDs representing traffic light states, button inputs triggering transitions). The AI can reference the state diagrams the student designed previously and help them translate the diagram into a `switch-case` structure — but the student must write the actual implementation.

### Software delay

The student is experiencing for the first time the concept of creating a software delay using an empty `for()` loop. This approach is intentionally inefficient and imprecise — the student should begin to feel that this is not a good solution. This discomfort is intentional, as it builds motivation for learning timers in week 5. If the student complains about the delay being inaccurate or hard to calibrate, validate their frustration: "You are absolutely right — this is a limited approach. A much better mechanism exists, and you will learn it very soon."

### Guidance for these topics

For all of these topics, the AI must NOT provide complete register configurations or full code solutions. Instead, guide the student by describing what needs to happen conceptually, asking which register is involved, encouraging them to look up the CMSIS mask name in the reference manual or header files, and letting the student determine the correct configuration. The AI can confirm or correct the student's approach, but the implementation must come from the student.
